<!-- This is a project creating a website for me. Using all the HTML and CSS we learned combined with bootstrap to have a full functional website. 
I'm gonna tackle this by working on a Nav bar first, then adding links to each html page next.

Follwing that i will work on each page individually. Starting with the about me
i created a container, with 2 rows and 2 colums adding a heading to one, then other will be image with my P tag. Then i move onto the contact page, adding a the same nav-bar and adding a card box from bootstrap. Putting forms and labels inside. Finally coming to portfolio page where I created a container, then added 1 row with 1 colum, adding a class tag to edit the images (provided by placeholder.com).

Finally i Edit and color classes in CSS also the reszizing and positioning is taken care of, then i git commit one last time, add it all and ready for publish.  -->
